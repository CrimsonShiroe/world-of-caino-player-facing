[[Bennet Thurlow]], a wealthy noble in Westerwren on Revai, has heard rumor that an old ruin outside the city may contain interesting curios and artefacts. Bennet intends to find the ones that interest him, and sell the others to fund future investments. The Party has been hired by him to delve into this ruin and unearth any treasures that lie within. Ahead of the Party he sent a garrison to establish a camp and guard the entrance to the ruins, to prevent any other individuals or organizations from raiding the ruins before he can. The forward garrison is lead by [[Darius Garnell]], a vetern of the [[Safeshore Invasion]], and [[Venetta Jehane]], a scholar from Naeve. Darius is in charge of the guardsmen, and is also the person the Party will report to. Venetta handles logistics as well as inspecting any treasures brought out of the ruins. The Party will be delivering the first shipment of supplies to the camp, acting as its guards on the way there.

The ruins themselves are more ancient than Bennet realizes, dating back to when the Fomorians ruled over Revai. Deep within the ruins lies a powerful artefact, and unearthing it draws the attention of the [[Greenbrothers]], who believe the artefact to be a key to unlocking their master's prison. Additionally, another adventuring party catches wind of a new powerful magical item being transported around, and they want it.
