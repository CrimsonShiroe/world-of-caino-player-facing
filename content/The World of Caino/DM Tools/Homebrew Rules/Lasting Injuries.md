### How Lasting Injuries Work
Lasting Injuries occur when a Player Character is Critically Hit by a monster controlled by the DM and the damage type is Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing. Instead of suffering extra damage, the Player Character instead rolls on the Lasting Injuries table. The size of the die is determined by the monster who Critically Hit the Player Character, with weaker monsters using a d6 while stronger monsters can use up to a d12. The higher the number, the worse the injury. Lasting Injuries also specify what level of healing magic is required to heal the wound, though most Lasting Injuries can be healed through mundane means as well. For example, a [[#Broken Rib]] can be healed either by spending seven days being treated by someone with Proficiency in Medicine, or a spell that restores hit points cast at at least 3rd Level.

### List of Lasting Injuries

#### Festering Wound
You have sustained a wound that has become infected. Whenever you take a Long Rest your Hit Point Maximum is reduced by 1 unless you recieve medical care from someone. Someone with proficiency in the Medicine skill can make a DC 15 Medicine check on you once every 24 hours, preventing your Hit Point Maximum from being reduced for that day. Alternatively, they automatically succeed on this check if they expend a use of a Healer's Kit. Once you have been successfully treated 7 times, your Festering Wound has fully healed and your Hit Point Maximum is restored. Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your wound.

#### Horrible Scar
You are disfigured to the extent that the wound cannot be easily concealed. You have Disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and Advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. If Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher is cast on you, and you wish for the scar to be removed, the spell also heals your scar.

#### Leg Injury
Your speed on foot is reduced by 10 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity Saving Throw after using the Dash Action. If you fail the save, you fall Prone. Someone with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill can fashion a splint for you, causing the speed reduction to be only 5 feet. Additionally, someone with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill can make a DC 10 Medicine check on you once every 24 hours. Once the check has been passed 3 times, your Leg Injury is healed. Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your injury.

#### Deathly Blow
You have suffered an extremely damaging injury. You have one permanent Death Saving Throw failure. A creature with Proficiency in Medicine can make a DC 10 Medicine check on you over the course of 10 minutes. On a success, your Deathly Blow is healed. Healing Magic of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your wound.

#### Broken Rib
This has the same effect as [[#Internal Injury]] below, except that the save DC is 10.

Whenever you take an Action in combat, you must make a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, you lose your Action and can't take Reactions until the start of your next turn. Once you spend seven days being treated by someone with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill your Broken Rib heals. Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your wound.

#### Concussion
You suffer a concussion. At the beginning of your turn, you make a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failure, choose Action or Bonus Action. You can only take the type of Action you chose on that turn. A creature with Proficiency in Medicine can treat you over the course of seven days. Once those seven days have passed, you are healed of your wound. Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your wound.

#### Exhausting Blow
You are struck hard and swiftly, causing your body to falter. You gain 2 levels of Exhaustion.

#### Internal Injury
Whenever you take an Action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failed save, you lose your Action and can't take Reactions until the start of your next turn. Once you spend seven days being treated by someone with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill your Internal Injury heals. Magical Healing of 4th Level or higher automatically heals your wound.

#### Broken Arm
This has the same effect as [[#Lose an Arm]] below, except it can be treated.

You can no longer hold anything in two hands, and you can only hold a single object at a time. You have Disadvantage on any checks made to climb unless you are assisted by a device (such as a ladder or a climber's kit). A creature with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill can tend to you over the course of several weeks. After 14 days of being treated by a creature with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill, your wound is healed. Magical Healing of 5th Level or higher automatically heals your wound.

#### Weakened Vitality
The blow you've suffered has had devastating effects on your body. Your Hit Point Maximum is reduced by half your total Hit Points and you can no longer hold Concentration. Once you spend a month being treated by a creature with Proficiency in the Medicine skill, your Hit Point Maximum and your ability to Concentrate return to normal. Alternatively, Magical Healing of 5th Level or higher automatically restores your Hit Point Maximum and allows you to Concentrate again.

#### Lose an Arm
You lose an arm. You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can only hold a single object at a time. You have Disadvantage on any checks made to climb unless you are assisted by a device (such as a ladder or a climber's kit). A [[Magical Prosthetic]] Arm heals you of this injury.
