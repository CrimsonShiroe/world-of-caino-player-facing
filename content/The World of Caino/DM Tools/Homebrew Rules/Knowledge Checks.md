Knowledge Checks are used in combat to determine the different Traits and Actions that various creatures might possess. For example, while fighting a Fire Elemental a Character could make an Arcana Check (the DC of which is determined on a per monster basis). If the Character succeeds, they will be able to identify one Trait or Action that the Fire Elemental has. Each Creature Type uses a specific type of Knowledge Check. Below is a list of which Knowledge Checks apply to which Creature Types.
