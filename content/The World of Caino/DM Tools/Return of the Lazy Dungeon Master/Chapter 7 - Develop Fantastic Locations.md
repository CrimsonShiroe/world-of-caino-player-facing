The way of the Lazy Dungeon Master helps us separate those things that are easily improvised from those things worth preparing. Building fantastic locations, for example, isn't easily done at the table. When we try to improvise locations, we're likely to fall back on stereotypical castles, familiar dungeons, and the samme old pair of huge statues with their hands out flanking the river. We need unique locations that inspire Characters to explore and that Players will remember. Thus, during our preparation, it's worth taking the time to develop a handful of fantastic locations that might come up during the game.

# What is a Fantastic Location?
A fantastic location can be anything. Some are as small as a single large room or chamber. Some are as large as an entire building. A city, a castle, or an entire dungeon is likely too large to be identified as a single location. It's better to split up the areas of such large sites into a series of fantastic locations.

You can think of a fantastic location as the set or backdrop for a single scene. As such, the size of the location should match the scope of the scene. In a scene focused on combat, the location might be just a room or chamber. In a larger exploration scene, it might be a series of interconnected rooms. When you're building a dungeon, each main room or area of related chambers can serve as a fantastic location.

# Start with an Evocative Name
For each fantastic location, you need only two components: an evocative name and the location's aspects. The name of the location should fire up the imaginations of you and the Players alike. It should capture the attention of the Players when you describe it. You don't need to write paragraphs of descriptive text for a location, though. You just need enough of a reminder to help you describe it to the Players during the game.

Evocative names cover locations like the following:

- The Hill of the Great Skull
- The Bridge of Teeth
- The Path of Screams

Obviously, different people reading the names of those locations might have different images immediately pop into their heads. But you aren't writing down your fantastic locations for anyone else. Rather, the evocative name is meant to **bookmark the image you had in your head**, creating a note that will remind you of that location when you need it during the game.

# Location Aspects
With an evocative name in place, it's time to add some useful details to your fantastic location. We'll call these *aspects*—a term borrowed from the *Fate Core* roleplaying game. These aspects act as short descriptive tags for your location.

In general, you'll want to have three aspects for a fantastic location, each of which describes an important, notable, or useful feature of the location. Aspects are features that the Characters can interact with, and that will mater to them. They also help you add detail to the location beyond the evocative name, by forcing you to build more of the location in your head while you prepare. With these aspects, a location becomes more than just an abstract vision.

The three locations above suggest any number of possible location aspects.

- **The Hill of the Great Skull:** Huge sabertoothed bestial skull bursting out of the ground; sharp bone shards thrust up out of the earth; circle of glyphs on the skull's forehead
- **The Bridge of Teeth:** Narrow bridge of bone spanning a gorge; bones tied together with cracked and splitting leather and sinew; howling wind sounds like moaning
- **The Path of Screams:** Icy path winding around sheer mountainous drop; faces frozen screaming in the icy walls; continuous small avalanches

Some of these aspects are descriptive. They'll remind you of what's going on at the location. All of them **offer something to the Players and Characters.** They're something to investigate, something to interact with. Some of those interactions might be really bad, like a sheer mountainous drop. Others might secrets or undsicovered power, like the glyphs on a huge skull's forehead. These aspects bring a tiny piece of each of these fantastic locations to life. They're often the things that make a location fantastic.

You might be tempted to write down more details than just the evocative name and aspects of a location—but you're best off ignoring this temptation. If you put too much energy into a location, you'll want to use it, even if the path of the story steers away from it. As with secrets and clues, you could end up throwing away even the most fantastic location if it never comes into play. You should prep only enough to help you run a location at the table—not so much that you feel invested in it.
