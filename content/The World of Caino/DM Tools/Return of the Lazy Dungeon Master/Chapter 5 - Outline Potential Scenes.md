With our [[Chapter 4 - Create a Strong Start|strong start]] written out, we might next write down the potential scenes that take place during the adventure. Sometimes we have one obvious path to take. Other times, there might be multiple options for the characters to follow. Either way, a short list  of potential scenes can help us feel as though we have a handle on the adventure.

The truth is, no GM can ever really have a full idea of where the adventure will go once that starting scene unfolds. But we can guess. Because these potential scenes might never actually come into play, we want to keep our scene outline loose and brief, so that we're not wasting a lot of time if we end up throwing them out. The outline itself doesn't need to be much more than a few words per line, with one or two lines per hour of game play. This list should be just enough to remind us of what's going on in the scene while we're running the game. Anything more than that is too much.

Sometimes we'll outline a list of sequential scenes expecting that the characters will go through one at a time. Other times, it's a list of scenes the characters might explore in any order. Or the scene outline might represent different branches to the story, each of which can take the characters off on a different path. Any of these models can work to help us get a handle on what we might see unfold at the table.

# A Primary Purpose of Peace of Mind
Like many of the techniques of the Lazy Dungeon Master, outlining potential scenes serves multiple purposes. First and most obviously, it helps you think about what might happen during the game. Even more importantly, it makes you feel confident that you have a handle on your game. You feel ready to play—and that's often all you need to be ready.

# Prepare to Throw it Away
> *"Be prepared to throw what you have away if something better happens at the table."*
> —Chris Perkins

The strength of being a Lazy Dungeon Master comes from being prepared—and also being ready to throw all that preparation away when the game goes in an unexpected direction. If you overprepare your game, it's easy to lose confidence. Nobody ever wants to throw away hours of work. You might fall in love with what you've prepared, so much so that you can't bear to let it go. You might spend so much time outlining your expected adventure that you don't have anything else ready when the Players and the Characters make choices you didn't see coming.

The easiest fix for this is to make sure you keep your outline brief. You want only enough information to remind you of what you had in mind for the scene—and no more than that. You keep the details of the scene purposefully brief. You expect that even within a scene, you're going to have to improvise anyways. And you prepare for that inprovisation.

Because in the end, none of the things you outline in your potential scenes become real until they actually take place at the table.

# Example Scenes for "The Scourge of Volixus"
Using our "Scourge of Volixus" example adventure, we can outline the following scenes. We might already have a strong sense of all the locations and NPCs when we outline—or we might be making them up in the outline for the first time, based on our sense of what the adventure needs.

- Investigate the armored caravan.
- Talk to Paula Dustyfingers the curio seller about the book the Hobgoblins wanted.
- Talk to the archivist Aluvena the Keeper, the custodian of Whitesparrow history.
- Find Littletoes, a Goblin who escaped from the battle.
- Follow the Hobgoblins' trail back to the Watchtower of Set.
- Travel through the Goblin warrens beneath the tower.
- Sneak into the inner keep of Grayspire, the Hobgoblins' mountain fortress.
- Face the Hobgoblin leader Volixus in the throne room.

As we outline, we're comfortable with the fact that some of these scenes might never happen. Some might be done out of order, even as others are clearly linear. Most importantly, each idea is short and to the point. And this makes it easy for us to toss all our starting ideas away if something better happens instead.
