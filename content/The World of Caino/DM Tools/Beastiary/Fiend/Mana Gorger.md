### **Traits**
**Expose Weakness.** Mana Gorgers have a limit on the amount of magic that they can contain within themselves before exploding. As an Action, a creature within 15 feet of the Mana Gorger can expend a Spell Slot to increase the magic level of the Mana Gorger by an amount equal to the Spell's level. Once a Mana Gorger has consumed 4 levels of Spell in this manner, it explodes and dies.

---
### **Actions**
**Consume.** The Mana Gorger attempts to consume something within 5 feet of it. If it targets a creature, it rolls against the creature's AC. On a hit, the creature takes 2d8 Piercing damage. Alternatively, the Mana Gorger can target a Spell or Spell Effect within 5 feet of itself. If it targets a Spell or Spell Effect, it rolls against the source of that Spell or Spell Effect's Spell Save DC. If it rolls above the DC, it consumes the Spell or Spell Effect and increases its magic level by 1.

---
### **Bonus Actions**
**Expel Mana.** [[Recharge]] 6. The Mana Gorger uses the pent up mana inside of itself as fuel for a magical attack. As a Bonus Action, the Mana Gorger can expend up to 3 levels of magic stored within itself. It then makes a Melee Attack against a creature within 5 feet of itself. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning damage (the Mana Gorger's choice when it uses this ability) for each level of magic expended. 

---
### **Reactions**
**Consume Mana.** As a Reaction when the Mana Gorger sees a creature cast a Spell within 15 feet of it, the Mana Gorger can make a Consume Attack as a Reaction, but it must target the Spell that was just cast. If it rolls above the Spell Save DC of the creature who cast the spell, it consumes the Spell and increases its own magic level by 1. The Spell has no effect.
