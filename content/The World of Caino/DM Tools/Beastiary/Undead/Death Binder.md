### **Actions**
**Soul Bind.** [[Recharge]] 6+. As an Action, the Death Binder targets one creature within 30 feet of itself. That creature must make a DC 16 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failure, its soul becomes bound to the Death Binder. If a creature other than the bound creature reduces the Death Binder's Hit Points to 0, that creature immediately dies and rises as a Death Binder.
