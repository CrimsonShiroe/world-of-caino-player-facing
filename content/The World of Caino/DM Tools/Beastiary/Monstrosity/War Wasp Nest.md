### **Traits**
**Expose Weakness.** There are a number of eggs attached to the side of the nest. You may take Disadvantage on an Attack against the War Wasp Nest. If you still hit, you destroy one of the eggs. This permanently reduces the number of War Wasps spawned from the Spawn Wasps Action by 1. 

---
### **Actions**
**Spawn Wasps.** [[Recharge]] 5+. The War Wasp Nest hatches some of the eggs contained within it to spawn 8 [[War Wasp|War Wasps]] to defend itself. 
**Enrage Wasps.** The War Wasp Nest releases pheromones that send nearby War Wasps into a frenzy. Up to 3 War Wasps within 15 feet of the War Wasp Nest gain Advantage on their next Attack.
