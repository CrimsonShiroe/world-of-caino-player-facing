### **Traits**
**Identify.** The Archivist does not follow the normal rules for [[Knowledge Checks]]. Instead, on Inititive Count 20, the Archivist chooses one creature within 60 feet of it. That creature may make a DC 12 Intelligence Saving Throw. On a failure, the Archivist gains one of that creature's class features until Initiative Count 1 and the creature loses the ability to use that class feature until Initiative Count 1. On a success, the creature identifies one of the Archivist's Traits or Actions.
**Elite.** This creature possesses two Initiatives.

---
### **Actions**
**Probing: Consume Knowledge.** As an Action, the Archivist targets a creature within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 15 Intelligence Saving Throw. On a failure, the target takes 3d8 Psychic damage and loses Proficiency in one Skill, Tool, or Weapon of the Archvisit's choice until the end of the target's next turn. The Archivist cannot target the same creature again until the end of the Archivist's next Probing Initiative.
**Mind: Assault the Mind.** As an Action, the Archivist targets a creature within 5 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 15 Intelligence Saving Throw. The target immediately takes 10 Psychic damage, and if it failed the Saving Throw, is [[Conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] until the end of its next turn.
**Crush.** As an Action, the Archivist slams its front legs into a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 Bludgeoning damage and must make a DC 12 Strength Saving Throw. On a failure, the target falls [[Conditions#Prone|Prone]].

---
### **Bonus Actions**
**Probing: Read Mind.** As a Bonus Action, the Archivist attempts to [[Conditions#Grappled|Grapple]] a [[Conditions#Prone|Prone]] creature within 5 feet of it. If it succeeds, it peels open the target's mind as if reading the pages of a book. The Archivist learns any one piece of information about the target, such as where it lives, the names and faces of people they know, or another important piece of information. The target takes 2d6 Psychic damage as they feel the Archivist pry through their mind.

---
### **Reactions**
**Opportunity Attack.** When a creature moves outside of the Archivist's [[Threatened Zone]], it can make one Crush Attack as a Reaction, but the target does not need to make a Strength Saving Throw and the damage is only 2d8 Bludgeoning.
**Sever Mind.** When a creature moves outside of the Archivist's [[Threatened Zone]], it can force that creature to make a DC 14 Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failure, the creature's mind is severed from its body. The creature's body falls to the floor and is considered [[Conditions#Unconscious|Unnconscious]]. The creature's mind becomes a ghostly image of its body. The mind cannot physically interact with the world around it, has a flying speed equal to its base walking speed, and any damage it deals that isn't Psychic damage is reduced to 0. The Archivist has Advantage on any Attack Roll it makes against the creature's mind. As an Action on the minds turn, it can return to its body.
