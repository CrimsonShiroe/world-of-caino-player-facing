# Overview
Revai, officially known as the Vaults of Revai, is an island nation off the western coast of mainland Caino. It is ruled over by the Merchant Princes, vastly wealthy individuals who control everything from imports and exports of goods to the laws that run Revai. Nobility within Revai is based off of an individual's level of wealth, rather than their family name. One such individual, Bennet Thurlow, has hired your party to investigate a set of ruins near Westerwren, a port city on Revai's western coast.
