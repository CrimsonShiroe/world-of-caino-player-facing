### **Traits**
**Expose Weakness.** It seems that Zombies requires its head to remain attached to its body in order to keep functioning. If you make a Melee Attack against the Zombie, you may take a -5 to the Attack Roll. If you still hit, you destroy it's brain and instantly kill the Zombie, bypassing its Undead Fortitude feature. You must take the -5 before making the Attack Roll.
**Undead Fortitude.** When the Zombie takes damage that would reduce it to 0 Hit Points, it instead drops to 1 Hit Point. Once this ability has been used, it can't be used again until the Zombie finishes a Long Rest.

---
### **Actions**
**Bite.** [[Recharge]] 6+. As an Action, the Zombie attempts to bite a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Piercing damage and must make a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failure, they take 2d4 Necrotic damage and become [[Conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] until they finish a Long Rest. While Poisoned in this way, if they drop to 0 Hit Points, they immediately die and rise as an Undead Zombie.
**Slam.** As an action, the Zombie attempts to bat at a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 Bludgeoning damage.

---
### **Bonus Actions**
**Summon Claw.** As a Bonus Action, the Zombie can rip off its own hand, which becomes a [[Crawling Claw]]. Roll initiative for the Claw. Once this ability has been used, it can't be used again unless the Claw is reattached to the Zombie's arm.

---
### **Reactions**
**Opportunity Attack.** When a creature moves outside of the Zombie's [[Threatened Zone]], it can make one Slam Attack as a Reaction.
