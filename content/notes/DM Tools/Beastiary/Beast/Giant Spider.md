### **Traits**
**Expose Weakness.** The Giant Spider has a particularly vulnerable underbelly, which you have realized how to properly take advantage of. While the Giant Spider is [[Conditions#Prone|Prone]] any Attack that hits it is a Critical Hit.

---
### **Actions**
**Bite.** The Giant Spider attempts to bite at a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d8+3 Piercing damage and must make a DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw. On a failure, the target takes 5 Poison damage and is Poisoned until the end of its next turn. If this Attack reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, they are Stable but [[Conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] for 1 hour, even after regaining Hit Points, and is [[Conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] while Poisoned in this way.

**Web.** [[Recharge]] 6. The Giant Spider quickly spins a web in a 20 foot cube around itself. The webs are [[Difficult Terrain]] and Lightly Obscures their area. Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a DC 14 Dexterity Saving Throw to avoid the webs. On a failed save, the creature is [[Conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. A creature Restrained by the webs can use its Action to make DC 14 Strength Saving Throw. If it succeeds, it is no longer Restrained. The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire. The Giant Spider is immune to webs.
