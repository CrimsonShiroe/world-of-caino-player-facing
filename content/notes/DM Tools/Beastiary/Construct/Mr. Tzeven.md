### **Traits**
**Talus Design.** T-7 was designed to be an indestructible super soldier, intended to be used to combat the Dethe. As such, the T-7 is Immune to all damage and Immune to most [[Conditions]]. 
**Gem Power Core.** The T-7 requires an immense amount of energy to remain functional. All of its abilities, magic, motor functions, and thought processes are power by its Gem Power Core. Without a Gem Power Core, the T-7 is rendered inert. 
**Sorcery Points.** The amount of power the T-7 has access to is measured in Sorcery Points. Every 24 hours it automatically consumes 1 Sorcery Point to keep itself animate. If it is unable to, it becomes inert. The T-7 also uses Sorcery Points to cast Spells, as per the [[Sorcery Points]] Spellcasting rules.

### **Actions**
