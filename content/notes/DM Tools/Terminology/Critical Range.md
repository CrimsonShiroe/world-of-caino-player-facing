The Critical Range of an Attack is the range of numbers the d20 can roll that results in a Critical Hit. By default, all Attacks have a Critical Range of 1, meaning they Critically Strike on a roll of 20 on a d20. Increasing the Critical Range of an Attack means increasing the range of numbers that can be rolled on a d20 that result in a Critical Strike. For example, an Attack with a Critical Range of 2 will Critically Strike on a roll of 19 and 20. Below is a table showing the lowest number that needs to be rolled to result in a Critical Strike, depending on the Critical Range.
