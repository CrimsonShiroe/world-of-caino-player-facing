# Anatomy of Secrets and Clues
A secret or clue is a single sentence that encapsulates a piece of your game world, its history, or the current story. It's a piece of information the Characters can discover as they explore the world and interact with its inhabitants. But secrets and clues are never trival, they contain information that *matters* to the Characters. They might be pieces of history that give the Characters and the Players a better view of why things are happening. They might be leads and hints that allow the Characters to discover special locations or powerful items. They might be information about NPCs that the Characters didn't already know.

Here's an example:

> Aluvena the Keeper, archivist for the Whitesparrow family, is a secret cultist of Dusk.

# Abstract from People, Places, and Things
During game preparation, you don't tie secrets and clues to the people, places, or things where they might be discovered. You don't worry about *how* the Characters will uncover a secret or clue. This is a critical component to the idea of secrets and clues, and parrt of the whole idea of "preparing to improvise."

A specific secret or clue should never need to come from one particular NPC's mouth, or from a single strange glyph on the keen edge of an ancient blade. When you're sitting down to write your secrets and clues, **you don't want to know how the Characters might find them.** That should always be dependent on what happens during the game, and that's out of your control.

Secrets and clues might be things the Characters learn while listening to gossip at the local eatery. They might be discoveries made on an old piece of parchment in a library. They might be something learned while interrogating a captured Goblin, or bits of history tied to a magic item found in a dragon's hoard. And from all these possibilities, you'll **improvise the discovery of a secret or clue while you run your game.**

Abstracting secrets and clues works particularly well with mysteries. You'll have no idea how the Characters might go about investigating a mystery. But as they do, you can drop in the right clues at the right time to help them solve it.

**The abstract nature of secrets and clues sits perfectly between preparation and improvisation.** You know the Characters will learn something interesting—but you don't know *how* they will learn it. You get to figure that out as it happens at the table.

# Write down ten Secrets per Session
When you're writing down your secrets and clues during your Lazy Dungeon Master preparation, shoot for ten. Any fewer, and you might not have enough of them. Too many and it can become difficult for you to quickly reference and use your secrets and clues at the table. 

Sometimes thinking up ten secrets is hard. But as you wrack your brain for those final few, **you'll often come up with the most interesting ones.** It sometimes takes great mental effort to dig deep into one's mind and find the diamonds buried within.

# Secrets Aren't Always Revealed
It's unlikely that you'll reveal all of the secrets and clues you write down during your preparation. That's fine. You're not wasting a lot of effort if you don't use them all, because you kept your toughts short. And that's much better than writing a thousand words about the history of an ancient watchtower that the characters never actually visit.

Sometimes your unrevealed secrets will make their way to your next session's list. Other times, they simply fade away. You might be tempted to keep a huge list of past secrets, but that can end up being unwieldy. The world is a dynamic place, and it's fine if you throw away old secrets. Just make sure you come up with a fresh list of ten new secrets and clues for every session.

# Secrets only Become real when Revealed
Secrets and clues don't become a real part of the game until they're revealed to the Characters and the Players. You might have some crazy revelation written down as a secret—maybe something like how the king's first retainer is actually a devil in disguise. That doesn't make it part of the campaign story until the Characters dicover it. If the Characters never come across that secret, it might turn out that the king's first retainer is exactly who she said she was all along.

# Unrefined Quests
Secrets and clues are often the ethereal goo that solidifies into quests. "The Goblins are building a terrible city-destroying war machine" is a secret. And when the Characters discover it and the Players discuss it, that secret automatically becomes a quest to "destroy the Goblins' terrible city-destroying war machine." You don't have to think of secrets and clues as quests or story hooks. But they'll often transform into those hooks if they catch the interest of the Players.

# Ten Example Secrets
Here are ten example secrets for our "Scourge of Volixus" adventure:
- The Hobgoblins are building a terrible city-destroying war machine in the western mountains.
- The war machine was forged in the fires of the Nine Hells centuries ago, and was lost in a great battle.
- The Hobgoblinshave Gnome tinkerers and alchemists working on the war machine, but it isn't clear whether those are prisoners or allies.
- A Hobgoblin Half-Dragon veteran known as Volixus the Burning Rage leads the Hobgoblins.
- In addition to his Goblin and Hobgoblin army, Volixus has hired a band of Igre mercenaries known as the Bonemashers.
- The Hobgoblins have taken over a ruined mountain fortress known as Grayspire.
- Centuries past, Grayspire served as the fortress headquarters of High Lord Grandel Whitesparrow, but it fell into ruin long ago.
- A nearly limitless series of sewers and catacombs spreads out beneath Grayspire—including some caverns and ancient ruins said to predate the construction of the citadel.
- Wraiths haunt the old Watchtower of Set, which sits above tunnels connecting it to the lower levels of Grayspire.
- The library of Lord Whitesparrow might hold old maps or clues to navigating the sewers and tunnels beneath Grayspire.
It's easy to see how these sample secrets tie monsters, NPCs, and locationst ogether. Some of these secrets and clues stand alone, while others lead to deeper secrets and more complex clues. All of them descibe a single fact the Characters and Players can learn as they adventure.

# Checklist for Defining Secrets and Clues
- Write down ten secrets and clues that the Characters might discover in the next game session.
- Secrets and clues are the connective tissue of a campaign. After the start of the adventure, they're the second most important thing to prepare.
- Each secret or clue reveals a piece of the story or the history of the world and its inhabitants. 
- Keep secrets and clues abstract from how they might be revealed. Improvise the discovery of secrets during the game.
- Throw away secrets that aren't revealed during a session. Write a fresh list each time.
