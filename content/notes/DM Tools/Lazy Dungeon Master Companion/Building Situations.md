DMs often build adventures from a string of sequential encounters, matching monsters and enviornments to be run in succession. Instead, consider building adventures around a larger situation—a location, a number of inhabitants with particular behaviors, and a goal for the Characters. That way, instead of simply playing through an outline of scenes, the Players create a more dynamic scenario by choosing how their Characters approach the location and its inhabitants to accomplish their goal.

Creating a situation for an adventure is as easy as coming up with those three elements—location, inhabitants, and goals—and seeing how they might work together. Considering the following example:
- A corrupt lord worships an archdevil within his keep, built on a rocky hill above the local village. (That’s our location, which might be set up using a map.)  
- In the keep’s cellars, mercenaries, cultists, and sentient oozes begin to poison the river flowing through the town. (Those are our inhabitants and their behaviors.)  
- The Characters must infiltrate the keep, destroy the machinery poisoning the river, and slay the corrupt lord. (Those are the characters’ goals.)

# Tips for Building Situations
When building situations in your game, keep the following tips in mind:  
- Think “big picture.” Think about how the inhabitants act and react across the whole location, not just in individual encounters.  
- Let the players fail forward. A single bad roll shouldn’t bring total disaster and defeat. Rather, let each failed roll lead to interesting complications.  
- Improvise upward and downward story beats during the game—moments that can make the players and characters feel like they’re accomplishing things, or which can dash their hopes and highlight the challenges they face.  
- Give the players enough information to plan a strategy.  
- Add both unexpected benefits and complications as the characters enact their plans.  
- Think about how the inhabitants of a location act and operate when left on their own. Then, during the game, think about how they react to the characters’ actions.

# Complications
