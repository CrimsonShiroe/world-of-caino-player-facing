# 3 Unique Things
Three to five unique things about this settlement. They do not have to be fantastical or magical, but often are. It could be a unique resource (i.e. [[Coldiron]]), a unique geogrpahical feature (i.e. a portal to another plane), a unique style (i.e. all houses are built on stilts), a unique group (i.e. river scavengers that pick away at sunken ruins), or any other aspect it has. They should be relevant and impactful, shaping not only how the town functions but also the experiences that the players have there.

# Districts
A district is a group of important locations that the party might visit that includes *at least* three locales. Actual size doesn't matter, a district can be anything from a genuine district to the farms on the eastern side of hamlet of 100 people. There is no limit to the number of locations in a district, but a minimum of three is a good starting point.  You can add more locations as necessary if the Players wish to delve deeper into a specific district, but you usually don't need anymore than three to flesh out the character of a district enough to make it interesting and believable. Finally, districts focus on locations that you believe the Players might go to. There should be at least 3 districts, but no more than 12.

# Wilderness Locales
Towns do not exist in a vacuum, they will have wilderness locales surrounding them. These could be a deadly dungeon, a circle of standing stones, or the lair of a powerful monster. They do, however, have some things in common. They should have a simple description, usually a few sentences until the Players seem interested. Second, an explanation on why the locale hasn't already been explored, plundered, or claimed. Finally, the locale should have something about it that draws the attention of the Players. It could simply be a pile of gold, or as esoteric as the promise of a forgotten secret. There should also be at least 1 more Wilderness Locale than there are Districts as it keeps the focus on adventuring.

# Threats
Threats are a quick tool to make your settlements feel active and responsive, while also allowing you to quickly come up with interesting events and quests. Threats operate off of a simplep rinciple, that having a centralized list of active issues in the town allows a DM to create a town that feels three dimensional while still being easy to run. There are two types of Threats, Internal Threats and External Threats. Secondly, Threats fall in one of four categories, being either Political, Social, Martial, or Economic. For example, a Red Dragon demanding more gold from the town would be an External Economic Threat. While this could edge into other categories, this is meant to be a shorthand, not nuanced. Next we ask how the threat is manifesting. The Red Dragon has been flying over the town once a week, and he sends Kobolds after each visit, who cause trouble and demand tribute. Next we ask the crucial question of how is this *actively* causing problems, and who, specifically, this is disrupting or harming. The Red Dragon has killed the leadership as an example in the past, but never the workers that provide the actual gold it wants. Finally, we ask more more important question, why hasn't this already been dealt with. If the town has the current ability to solve the issue, then it isn't a Threat. 

The ratio of Internal to External Threats can say a lot about the nature of a settlement. A settlement with more Internal Threats could be choking under its own weight, the people within might be at each other's throats, or powerful individuals or groups could be cutting the town into pieces as they grasp for more power. A settlement with more External Threats could be barely keeping itself from being overrun by the oppressive wilderness, or could be beset upon all sides by schemers and political forces that take any number of hostile actions upon the town.

## Internal Threats
There should always be at least 3 Internal Threats, and, with larger cities, a number equal to the number of districts minus two might be appropriate. Not all Internal Threats need to be massive, but they should at least be felt across an entire district. If they are not, they are a separate, smaller issue, and not an Internal Threat. Moreover, while this is not always the case, an Internal Threat is often an issue that arises from a specific district. Looking at each district and asking what could disrupt it is a good way to get inspiration for Internal Threats.

### Internal Threat 1
- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic
- How is the Internal Threat manifesting
- How is the Internal Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming
- Why hasn't it been dealt it

### Internal Threat 2
- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic
- How is the Internal Threat manifesting
- How is the Internal Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming
- Why hasn't it been dealt it

### Internal Threat 3
- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic
- How is the Internal Threat manifesting
- How is the Internal Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming
- Why hasn't it been dealt it

## External Threats
External Threats can be anything outside the boundaries of the settlement, but a particular focus on issues arising from uncivilized or monstrous sources can reinforce the lawlessness of a setting, while a focus on other settlements can create more political tensions.

### External Threat 1
- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic
- How is the External Threat manifesting
- How is the External Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming
- Why hasn't it been dealt it

### External Threat 2
- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic
- How is the External Threat manifesting
- How is the External Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming
- Why hasn't it been dealt it

### External Threat 3
- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic
- How is the External Threat manifesting
- How is the External Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming
- Why hasn't it been dealt it

# Relationships
A Relationship should be active and juicy, and should have a good verb. "They need Town X" is a bad Relationship. "They rely on Town X for protection, but are unthankful for it" is better, but "They need Town X's protection, but resent the superior, condescending attitude of Town X" reveals even more. These should be a generalization, made from the POV of the average member of the settlement in question. Named NPCs have their own thoughts. Make one of these per important populated location that interacts with the town.
