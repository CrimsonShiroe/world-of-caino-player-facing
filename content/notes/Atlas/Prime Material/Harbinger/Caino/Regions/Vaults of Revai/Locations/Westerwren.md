# Unique Qualities of Westerwren
- The ocean surrounding Westerwren has an unusually high population of fish, both edible and deadly. This has lead to the Westerwren fishing market to boom, and the city provides most of the fish that Revai consumes. Additionally, due to the high volumes of dangerous sea creatures, adventurers are often hired to protect trade and passenger ships on their way to and from Westerwren.
- Westerwren's government is mostly hands off with everything, allowing rich nobles to set their own rules for how their businesses operate. Due to this, the city guard is mostly a symbolic organization who have no real teeth. Private guardships that report back to their noble lords normally keep the peace within the city, although conflicts between them are not uncommon.
- The land that Westerwren is built upon was not an empty area. A great city of the Fomorians sat here, and Westerwren was built atop its ruins. Local adventuring guilds often send out parties into the depths of those ruins, deep beneth even the lowest layers of Westerwren. While the topmost layers of the ruins have been mostly picked clean and are sometimes used by thieves as a hideout, the depths are still teeming with monsters...and treasure.

# Districts

## Pearlsquare
Pearlsquare is the largest mercantile district in Westerwren. Almost all shops are located here, and almost anything is for sale here. While it lacks the pageantry and flare of [[Silvervault]]'s trade district, it is still an impressive feat.
1. The Burning Dog
	- The Burning Dog is the most popular tavern in Westerwren. Everyone from nobles to thieves visit it, and it's named after its most famous drink, the Burning Dog, which will make you feel like you're on fire. It's owned and operated by Alphonse Deloc, a Human.
2. Clean Getaway
	- Clean Getaway is a general goods store, and on the surface is not of much note. However, the thieves in the city all know if it as the primary fence in Westerwren. The owner, Maxine Rosehand, will buy almost anything from anyone. 
3. The Blissful Bite
	- The Blissful Bite is a restaurant famously known for its food that revitalizes and strengthens you. The owner, a mysterious dragonborn, keeps exactly how the food does this, but investigators have concluded that the food is magically enhanced somehow. Adventurers often frequent the Blissful Bite prior to setting out on missions.

## The Docks
The Docks are the main hub for trade coming in and out of Westerwren. Everyday hundreds of dockworkers come and unload ship after ship, ensuring that the flow of trade through the city remains constant.
1. Pier 331
	- Pier 331 is a special pier. The thieves' guild is in control of it, and many illegal goods are smuggled through it. Anyone wanting something hard to get within the city needs to put in a request with the Piermaster, Donovan, here.
2. The Dockhand
	- The Dockhand is a inn located very near the main thoroughfare between the Docks and the rest of the city. It has a rather scandalous reputation, being a gathering place for scoundrels and thugs. It's owned by the local thieves' guild.
3. Grand Shipping
	1. Grand Shipping is the main shipping company in Westerwren. It handles most incoming and outgoing shipments. Other shipping companies also rely on it to handle their paperwork. As a result the owner, Nicholas Grand, is a very useful source of information within the city.

## East District
East District is located outside the eastern gate of Westerwren. It's mainly where most farmers in the city live, as well as tradesmen. People come here to repair their tools and have furniture made for them.
1. Becky's Blacksmith
	- Becky's Blacksmith, owned by Becky Yarn, is located fairly close to the eastern gate. She's known for her great work in repairing weaponry and armor and is very familiar with most of the adventurers that come through the city. She's a great source of information due to her familiarness with local adventurers.
2. Farmer's Rest
	- Farmer's Rest is a quaint tavern located on the edge of East District. It's a favorite of many farmers when they want to unwind at the end of their day, and features many tasty foods and drinks. It also has a notice board out front where farmers will often post jobs when they need the help of adventurers.
3. Agatha's Potions and Other Potions
	- Agatha moved to Westerwren very recently and opened up a potion shop, although she mainly sells medicinal herbs and heals minor injuries.

# Threats

## Internal Threats

### Gregory Thorns wants The Docks
- Category of Threat: Political
- Gregory Thorns is a wealthy merchant who has come to the conclusion that the Dockmasters and their companies have too much power within the city. He's decided that he would like to claim their businesses for himself, and install Dockmasters who are loyal to him and him only. He has slowly been weaseling his loyal lieutenants into the higher ranks of these companies in an attempt to take control of them.
- Business is starting to slow down, as the Dockmasters must divert more and more of their attention to deaing with Gregory and his lieutenants. Some other nobles have started to notice the effects of Gregory's takeover harming their own profits, but he has paid them off to turn a blind eye for now.

### Fishing Catches are Down
- Category of Threat: Economic
- Fishing catches are starting to go down, and nobody is sure why.
- With fishing catches down, profits are also starting to plummit. This is causing issues for the nobles in the fishing industry, as well as interfering with the food supply of the city.
