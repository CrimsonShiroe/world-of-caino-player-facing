This has lead to the Westerwren fishing market to boom, and the city provides most of the fish that Revai consumes. Additionally, due to the high volumes of dangerous sea creatures, adventurers are often hired to protect trade and passenger ships on their way to and from Westerwren.\n- Westerwren's government is mostly hands off with everything, allowing rich nobles to set their own rules for how their businesses operate. Due to this, the city guard is mostly a symbolic organization who have no real teeth. Private guardships that report back to their noble lords normally keep the peace within the city, although conflicts between them are not uncommon.\n- The land that Westerwren is built upon was not an empty area. A great city of the Fomorians sat here, and Westerwren was built atop its ruins. Local adventuring guilds often send out parties into the depths of those ruins, deep beneth even the lowest layers of Westerwren. While the topmost layers of the ruins have been mostly picked clean and are sometimes used by thieves as a hideout, the depths are still teeming with monsters...and treasure.\n\n![[westerwren.png]]\n\n# Districts\n\n## Pearlsquare\nPearlsquare is the largest mercantile district in Westerwren. Almost all shops are located here, and almost anything is for sale here. While it lacks the pageantry and flare of [[Silvervault]]'s trade district, it is still an impressive feat.\n1. The Burning Dog\n\t- The Burning Dog is the most popular tavern in Westerwren. Everyone from nobles to thieves visit it, and it's named after its most famous drink, the Burning Dog, which will make you feel like you're on fire. It's owned and operated by Alphonse Deloc, a Human.\n2. Clean Getaway\n\t- Clean Getaway is a general goods store, and on the surface is not of much note. However, the thieves in the city all know if it as the primary fence in Westerwren. The owner, Maxine Rosehand, will buy almost anything from anyone. \n3. The Blissful Bite\n\t- The Blissful Bite is a restaurant famously known for its food that revitalizes and strengthens you. The owner, a mysterious dragonborn, keeps exactly how the food does this, but investigators have concluded that the food is magically enhanced somehow. Adventurers often frequent the Blissful Bite prior to setting out on missions.\n\n## The Docks\nThe Docks are the main hub for trade coming in and out of Westerwren. Everyday hundreds of dockworkers come and unload ship after ship, ensuring that the flow of trade through the city remains constant.\n1. Pier 331\n\t- Pier 331 is a special pier. The thieves' guild is in control of it, and many illegal goods are smuggled through it. Anyone wanting something hard to get within the city needs to put in a request with the Piermaster, Donovan, here.\n2. The Dockhand\n\t- The Dockhand is a inn located very near the main thoroughfare between the Docks and the rest of the city. It has a rather scandalous reputation, being a gathering place for scoundrels and thugs. It's owned by the local thieves' guild.\n3. Grand Shipping\n\t1. Grand Shipping is the main shipping company in Westerwren. It handles most incoming and outgoing shipments. Other shipping companies also rely on it to handle their paperwork. As a result the owner, Nicholas Grand, is a very useful source of information within the city.\n\n## East District\nEast District is located outside the eastern gate of Westerwren. It's mainly where most farmers in the city live, as well as tradesmen. People come here to repair their tools and have furniture made for them.\n1. Becky's Blacksmith\n\t- Becky's Blacksmith, owned by Becky Yarn, is located fairly close to the eastern gate. She's known for her great work in repairing weaponry and armor and is very familiar with most of the adventurers that come through the city. She's a great source of information due to her familiarness with local adventurers.\n2. Farmer's Rest\n\t- Farmer's Rest is a quaint tavern located on the edge of East District. It's a favorite of many farmers when they want to unwind at the end of their day, and features many tasty foods and drinks. It also has a notice board out front where farmers will often post jobs when they need the help of adventurers.\n3. Agatha's Potions and Other Potions\n\t- Agatha moved to Westerwren very recently and opened up a potion shop, although she mainly sells medicinal herbs and heals minor injuries.\n\n# Wilderness Locales\n\n## Fomorian Stones\n- What it is: An ancient Fomorian temple, consisting of a stone floor atop a hill surrounded by standing stones.\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable: Druids frequent this location to perform rituals and rites, any attempt to stop them is often met with violence.\n- Why it's adventure worthy: At night, mysterious spirits are said to wander within, and many believe there is a tomb within somewhere.\n\n## Sea Caves\n- What it is: A series of caves located inside some cliffs a little north of Westerwren.\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable: The caves often flood when the tides come in, making it dangerous to be in them at the wrong time.\n- Why it's adventure worthy: Sea Hags have made a lair deep within the caves, and are starting to kidnap locals for their dark rituals.\n\n## Islet of Mary\n- What it is: A small islet about an hour voyage from the Docks of Westerwren.\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable: A large Roc has made its nest there, and often harasses ships and steals valuables.\n- Why it's adventure worthy: The Roc has stolen certain valuable items, and possibly even managed to grab some of a magical nature from unlucky adventurers.\n\n## Ruins of Thunderwatch\n- What is is: A small village about a thirty minute walk south of Westerwren.\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable: a dark sorcerer was slighted there, and cursed the inhabitants to rise as undead creatures when they died.\n- Why it's adventure worthy: The village's mage held many valuable tomes that might be worth reclaiming.\n\n# Threats\n\n## Internal Threats\n\n### Gregory Thorns wants The Docks\n- Category of Threat: Political\n- Gregory Thorns is a wealthy merchant who has come to the conclusion that the Dockmasters and their companies have too much power within the city. He's decided that he would like to claim their businesses for himself, and install Dockmasters who are loyal to him and him only. He has slowly been weaseling his loyal lieutenants into the higher ranks of these companies in an attempt to take control of them.\n- Business is starting to slow down, as the Dockmasters must divert more and more of their attention to deaing with Gregory and his lieutenants. Some other nobles have started to notice the effects of Gregory's takeover harming their own profits, but he has paid them off to turn a blind eye for now.\n- The Dockmasters don't have the time to fully deal with Gregory, and the nobles of the city currently are being paid off to not cause problems.\n\n### Fishing Catches are Down\n- Category of Threat: Economic\n- Fishing catches are starting to go down, and nobody is sure why.\n- With fishing catches down, profits are also starting to plummit. This is causing issues for the nobles in the fishing industry, as well as interfering with the food supply of the city.\n- Nobody is entirely sure why fishing catches aren't as high as they should be yet, but investigations are ongoing.\n\n### A Rival Thieves' Guild Appears\n- Category of Threat: Martial\n- A 2nd thieves' guild has popped up within Westerwren, and is now fighting with the original thieves' guild.\n- Gang violence has gone up and people are starting to get scared. Additionally, it's becoming more and more dangerous for thieves to take on jobs due to the threat of running into other thieves.\n- For the most part the nobles are unaffected and thus do not want to waste time or money on stopping either guild.\n\n## External Threats\n\n### Monsters Harassing Famers\n- Category of Threat: Martial\n- Monsters have begun raiding local farmers, stealing livestock and destroying crops.\n- The food supply of the city is in danger, and the lives of farmers are at risk.\n- Efforts to track down the monsters have proven unsuccessful at best and deadly at worst.\n\n### A Merchant Prince Finds Interest in Westerwren\n- Category of Threat: Political\n- One of the Merchant Princes in Silvervault has been wanting to break into the fishing industry, and sees Westerwren as a threat to his new company.\n- The Merchant Prince has been levying taxes on fishing vessels in an attempt to minimize the profits of some of the nobles in Westerwren.\n- The nobles of Westerwren are too nervous to upset the Merchant Prince.\n\n# Relationships\n\n## Needlewall\n- Needlewall largely despises Westerwren due to them levying harsh import tariffs on products made and produced in Needlewall.\n- Westerwren is mostly ignorant of the Needlewall and does not care much for the city.\n\n*credit to u/Lazeerlow on reddit for the template*\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.403823617Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Atlas/Prime-Material/Harbinger/Caino/Six-Truths-of-Caino":{"title":"Six Truths of Caino","content":"- Around 800 or so years ago, the majority of the continent was ruled over by the Talus: large beings of stone who were magically and technologically advanced. Opposing them were the Fomorians: powerful Fey creatures who used mysterious magics and ruled with iron fists. A war broke out between them that almost wiped out the mortal races of the world, until both the Talus and the Fomorians mysteriously disappeared.\n- The gods exist within the world but more often than not work in a hands off manner, letting their most devoted followers take charge of their duties on the Material Plane.\n- Far out into the oceans that surround Caino are mysterious storms that block travel beyond them. Though many voyages have set out to travel beyond them, none have returned, leaving the world beyond Caino‚Äôs oceans a mystery.\n- The world is largely at peace between countries, save for Belond and Drathar who are at best in a cold war and at worst are on the cusp of conflict. Other countries also maintain rivalries that could grow into something more, but generally they remain at peace. The main threat that concerns most people are the monstrous creatures that roam Caino.\n- Magic is very common, with many people being able to perform minor acts of magic or can gain the ability to do so through practice and training.\n- Technology in the world is fairly advanced, with electricity being common in cities and trains being the main method of long distance travel. Most ships however remain sailing ships as the great distances they need to cover make the cost of transporting fuel too great.","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Campaigns/A-Call-for-Adventure/Session-Notes/Session-0":{"title":"Session 0","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Campaigns/Favor-and-Fortune/Non-Player-Characters/Bennet-Thurlow":{"title":"Bennet Thurlow","content":"#favorandfortune","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Campaigns/Favor-and-Fortune/Non-Player-Characters/Darius-Garnell":{"title":"Darius Garnell","content":"#favorandfortune","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Campaigns/Favor-and-Fortune/Non-Player-Characters/Venetta-Jehane":{"title":"Venetta Jehane","content":"#favorandfortune","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Campaigns/Favor-and-Fortune/Session-Notes/Campaign-Primer":{"title":"Campaign Primer","content":"#favorandfortune\n# Overview\nRevai, officially known as the Vaults of Revai, is an island nation off the western coast of mainland Caino.

One such individual, Bennet Thurlow, has hired your party to investigate a set of ruins near Westerwren, a port city on Revai's western coast. \n\n![[Revai.webp]]\n\n- Recent Events\n- Important NPCs\n- Important Factions\n- Religion\n- Magic\n- Brief Description of the Settings\n- Map","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/Campaigns/Favor-and-Fortune/Session-Notes/Overview":{"title":"Overview","content":"#favorandfortune\n[[Bennet Thurlow]], a wealthy noble in Westerwren on Revai, has heard rumor that an old ruin outside the city may contain interesting curios and artefacts. Bennet intends to find the ones that interest him, and sell the others to fund future investments. The Party has been hired by him to delve into this ruin and unearth any treasures that lie within. Ahead of the Party he sent a garrison to establish a camp and guard the entrance to the ruins, to prevent any other individuals or organizations from raiding the ruins before he can. The forward garrison is lead by [[Darius Garnell]], a vetern of the [[Safeshore Invasion]], and [[Venetta Jehane]], a scholar from Naeve. Darius is in charge of the guardsmen, and is also the person the Party will report to. Venetta handles logistics as well as inspecting any treasures brought out of the ruins. The Party will be delivering the first shipment of supplies to the camp, acting as its guards on the way there.\n\nThe ruins themselves are more ancient than Bennet realizes, dating back to when the Fomorians ruled over Revai. Deep within the ruins lies a powerful artefact, and unearthing it draws the attention of the [[Greenbrothers]], who believe the artefact to be a key to unlocking their master's prison. Additionally, another adventuring party catches wind of a new powerful magical item being transported around, and they want it.

Instead of suffering extra damage, the Player Character instead rolls on the Lasting Injuries table. The size of the die is determined by the monster who Critically Hit the Player Character, with weaker monsters using a d6 while stronger monsters can use up to a d12. The higher the number, the worse the injury. Lasting Injuries also specify what level of healing magic is required to heal the wound, though most Lasting Injuries can be healed through mundane means as well. For example, a [[#Broken Rib]] can be healed either by spending seven days being treated by someone with Proficiency in Medicine, or a spell that restores hit points cast at at least 3rd Level.\n\nDie | Lasting Injury         | Level of Healing Magic to Cure\n:--:|------------------------|:-----------------------------:\n1   | [[#Festering Wound]]   | 3rd\n2   | [[#Horrible Scar]]     | 3rd\n3   | [[#Leg Injury]]        | 3rd\n4   | [[#Deathly Blow]]      | 3rd\n5   | [[#Broken Rib]]        | 3rd\n6   | [[#Concussion]]        | 3rd\n7   | [[#Exhausting Blow]]   | 4th\n8   | [[#Internal Injury]]   | 4th\n9   | [[#Broken Arm]]        | 5th\n10  | [[#Weakened Vitality]] | 5th\n11  | [[#Lose an Arm]]       | N/A\n12  | [[#Lose an Eye]]       | N/A\n\n### List of Lasting Injuries\n\n#### Festering Wound\nYou have sustained a wound that has become infected. Whenever you take a Long Rest your Hit Point Maximum is reduced by 1 unless you recieve medical care from someone. Someone with proficiency in the Medicine skill can make a DC 15 Medicine check on you once every 24 hours, preventing your Hit Point Maximum from being reduced for that day. Alternatively, they automatically succeed on this check if they expend a use of a Healer's Kit. Once you have been successfully treated 7 times, your Festering Wound has fully healed and your Hit Point Maximum is restored. Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your wound.\n\n#### Horrible Scar\nYou are disfigured to the extent that the wound cannot be easily concealed. You have Disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and Advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. If Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher is cast on you, and you wish for the scar to be removed, the spell also heals your scar.\n\n#### Leg Injury\nYour speed on foot is reduced by 10 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity Saving Throw after using the Dash Action. If you fail the save, you fall Prone. Someone with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill can fashion a splint for you, causing the speed reduction to be only 5 feet. Additionally, someone with Proficiency in the Medicine Skill can make a DC 10 Medicine check on you once every 24 hours. Once the check has been passed 3 times, your Leg Injury is healed. Magical Healing of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your injury.\n\n#### Deathly Blow\nYou have suffered an extremely damaging injury. You have one permanent Death Saving Throw failure. A creature with Proficiency in Medicine can make a DC 10 Medicine check on you over the course of 10 minutes. On a success, your Deathly Blow is healed. Healing Magic of 3rd Level or higher automatically heals your wound.\n\n#### Broken Rib\nThis has the same effect as [[#Internal Injury]] below, except that the save DC is 10.\n\nWhenever you take an Action in combat, you must make a DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw.

Instead, consider building adventures around a larger situation‚Äîa location, a number of inhabitants with particular behaviors, and a goal for the Characters. That way, instead of simply playing through an outline of scenes, the Players create a more dynamic scenario by choosing how their Characters approach the location and its inhabitants to accomplish their goal.\n\nCreating a situation for an adventure is as easy as coming up with those three elements‚Äîlocation, inhabitants, and goals‚Äîand seeing how they might work together. Considering the following example:\n- A corrupt lord worships an archdevil within his keep, built on a rocky hill above the local village. (That‚Äôs our location, which might be set up using a map.)  \n- In the keep‚Äôs cellars, mercenaries, cultists, and sentient oozes begin to poison the river flowing through the town. (Those are our inhabitants and their behaviors.)  \n- The Characters must infiltrate the keep, destroy the machinery poisoning the river, and slay the corrupt lord. (Those are the characters‚Äô goals.)\n\n# Tips for Building Situations\nWhen building situations in your game, keep the following tips in mind:  \n- Think ‚Äúbig picture.‚Äù Think about how the inhabitants act and react across the whole location, not just in individual encounters.  \n- Let the players fail forward. A single bad roll shouldn‚Äôt bring total disaster and defeat. Rather, let each failed roll lead to interesting complications.  \n- Improvise upward and downward story beats during the game‚Äîmoments that can make the players and characters feel like they‚Äôre accomplishing things, or which can dash their hopes and highlight the challenges they face.  \n- Give the players enough information to plan a strategy.  \n- Add both unexpected benefits and complications as the characters enact their plans.  \n- Think about how the inhabitants of a location act and operate when left on their own. Then, during the game, think about how they react to the characters‚Äô actions.\n\n# Complications\nWhile the Characters are involved in a situation, they might run into a complication like one of the following.\n\n![[Building Situations Tables#Complications]]\n\n# Example Locations\nAny of the following locations can work for building a situation. Let the location suggest as many options as possible by including multiple entrances and multiple paths the characters can follow within the location.\n\n![[Building Situations Tables#Locations]]\n\n# Example Inhabitants\nWhen building a situation, populate locations with creatures that make sense for the story. Always think about the big picture when considering things like how creatures move within a location.\n\n![[Building Situations Tables#Inhabitants]]\n\n# Example Goals\nClear goals similar in setup to those on the following table are critical when running adventures featuring open-ended and flexible situations built from locations and inhabitants. Ensure that these goals are their importance are clear to the Players.\n\n![[Building Situations

5 - Outline Potential Scenes","content":"#lazydm\nWith our [[Chapter 4 - Create a Strong Start|strong start]] written out, we might next write down the potential scenes that take place during the adventure. Sometimes we have one obvious path to take. Other times, there might be multiple options for the characters to follow. Either way, a short list  of potential scenes can help us feel as though we have a handle on the adventure.\n\nThe truth is, no GM can ever really have a full idea of where the adventure will go once that starting scene unfolds. But we can guess. Because these potential scenes might never actually come into play, we want to keep our scene outline loose and brief, so that we're not wasting a lot of time if we end up throwing them out. The outline itself doesn't need to be much more than a few words per line, with one or two lines per hour of game play. This list should be just enough to remind us of what's going on in the scene while we're running the game. Anything more than that is too much.\n\nSometimes we'll outline a list of sequential scenes expecting that the characters will go through one at a time. Other times, it's a list of scenes the characters might explore in any order. Or the scene outline might represent different branches to the story, each of which can take the characters off on a different path. Any of these models can work to help us get a handle on what we might see unfold at the table.\n\n# A Primary Purpose of Peace of Mind\nLike many of the techniques of the Lazy Dungeon Master, outlining potential scenes serves multiple purposes. First and most obviously, it helps you think about what might happen during the game. Even more importantly, it makes you feel confident that you have a handle on your game. You feel ready to play‚Äîand that's often all you need to be ready.\n\n# Prepare to Throw it Away\n\u003e *\"Be prepared to throw what you have away if something better happens at the table.\"*\n\u003e ‚ÄîChris Perkins\n\nThe strength of being a Lazy Dungeon Master comes from being prepared‚Äîand also being ready to throw all that preparation away when the game goes in an unexpected direction. If you overprepare your game, it's easy to lose confidence. Nobody ever wants to throw away hours of work. You might fall in love with what you've prepared, so much so that you can't bear to let it go. You might spend so much time outlining your expected adventure that you don't have anything else ready when the Players and the Characters make choices you didn't see coming.\n\nThe easiest fix for this is to make sure you keep your outline brief. You want only enough information to remind you of what you had in mind for the scene‚Äîand no more than that. You keep the details of the scene purposefully brief. You expect that even within a scene, you're going to have to improvise anyways. And you prepare for that inprovisation.\n\nBecause in the end, none of the things you outline in your potential scenes become real until they actually take place at the table.\n\n# Example Scenes for \"The Scourge of Volixus\"\nUsing our \"Scourge of Volixus\" example adventure, we can outline the following scenes. We might already have a strong sense of all the locations and NPCs when we outline‚Äîor we might be making them up in the outline for the first time, based on our sense of what the adventure needs.\n\n- Investigate the armored caravan.\n- Talk to Paula Dustyfingers the curio seller about the book the Hobgoblins wanted.\n- Talk to the archivist Aluvena the Keeper, the custodian of Whitesparrow history.\n- Find Littletoes, a Goblin who escaped from the battle.\n- Follow the Hobgoblins' trail back to the Watchtower of Set.\n- Travel through the Goblin warrens beneath the tower.\n- Sneak into the inner keep of Grayspire, the Hobgoblins' mountain fortress.\n- Face the Hobgoblin leader Volixus in the throne room.\n\nAs we outline, we're comfortable with the fact that some of these scenes might never happen. Some might be done out of order, even as others are clearly linear. Most importantly, each idea is short and to the point. And this makes it easy for us to toss all our starting ideas away if something better happens instead.\n\n# Checklist for Outlining Potential Scenes\n- [ ] Write down a short list of scenes that might occur in your game.\n- [ ] Remember that the goal of writing down scenes is primarily to help you feel prepared.\n- [ ] Scenes can occur in or out of sequence.\n- [ ] Write only as much as you need to remind yourself of what might happen.\n- [ ] Don't fall in love with your scenes. Be prepared to throw them away.","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Return-of-the-Lazy-Dungeon-Master/Chapter-6-Define-Secrets-and-Clues":{"title":"Chapter 6 - Define Secrets and Clues","content":"#lazydm\n# Anatomy of Secrets and Clues\nA secret or clue is a single sentence that encapsulates a piece of your game world, its history, or the current story. It's a piece of information the Characters can discover as they explore the world and interact with its inhabitants. But secrets and clues are never trival, they contain information that *matters* to the Characters. They might be pieces of history that give the Characters and the Players a better view of why things are happening. They might be leads and hints that allow the Characters to discover special locations or powerful items. They might be information about NPCs that the Characters didn't already know.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n\u003e Aluvena the Keeper, archivist for the Whitesparrow family, is a secret cultist of Dusk.\n\n# Abstract from People, Places, and Things\nDuring game preparation, you don't tie secrets and clues to the people, places, or things where they might be discovered. You don't worry about *how* the Characters will uncover a secret or clue. This is a critical component to the idea of secrets and clues, and parrt of the whole idea of \"preparing to improvise.\"\n\nA specific secret or clue should never need to come from one particular NPC's mouth, or from a single strange glyph on the keen edge of an ancient blade. When you're sitting down to write your secrets and clues, **you don't want to know how the Characters might find them.** That should always be dependent on what happens during the game, and that's out of your control.\n\nSecrets and clues might be things the Characters learn while listening to gossip at the local eatery. They might be discoveries made on an old piece of parchment in a library. They might be something learned while interrogating a captured Goblin, or bits of history tied to a magic item found in a dragon's hoard. And from all these possibilities, you'll **improvise the discovery of a secret or clue while you run your game.**\n\nAbstracting secrets and clues works particularly well with mysteries. You'll have no idea how the Characters might go about investigating a mystery. But as they do, you can drop in the right clues at the right time to help them solve it.\n\n**The abstract nature of secrets and clues sits perfectly between preparation and improvisation.** You know the Characters will learn something interesting‚Äîbut you don't know *how* they will learn it. You get to figure that out as it happens at the table.\n\n# Write down ten Secrets per Session\nWhen you're writing down your secrets and clues during your Lazy Dungeon Master preparation, shoot for ten. Any fewer, and you might not have enough of them. Too many and it can become difficult for you to quickly reference and use your secrets and clues at the table. \n\nSometimes thinking up ten secrets is hard. But as you wrack your brain for those final few, **you'll often come up with the most interesting ones.** It sometimes takes great mental effort to dig deep into one's mind and find the diamonds buried within.\n\n# Secrets Aren't Always Revealed\nIt's unlikely that you'll reveal all of the secrets and clues you write down during your preparation. That's fine. You're not wasting a lot of effort if you don't use them all, because you kept your toughts short. And that's much better than writing a thousand words about the history of an ancient watchtower that the characters never actually visit.\n\nSometimes your unrevealed secrets will make their way to your next session's list. Other times, they simply fade away. You might be tempted to keep a huge list of past secrets, but that can end up being unwieldy. The world is a dynamic place, and it's fine if you throw away old secrets. Just make sure you come up with a fresh list of ten new secrets and clues for every session.\n\n# Secrets only Become real when Revealed\nSecrets and clues don't become a real part of the game until they're revealed to the Characters and the Players. You might have some crazy revelation written down as a secret‚Äîmaybe something like how the king's first retainer is actually a devil in disguise. That doesn't make it part of the campaign story until the Characters dicover it. If the Characters never come across that secret, it might turn out that the king's first retainer is exactly who she said she was all along.\n\n# Unrefined Quests\nSecrets and clues are often the ethereal goo that solidifies into quests. \"The Goblins are building a terrible city-destroying war machine\" is a secret. And when the Characters discover it and the Players discuss it, that secret automatically becomes a quest to \"destroy the Goblins' terrible city-destroying war machine.\" You don't have to think of secrets and clues as quests or story hooks. But they'll often transform into those hooks if they catch the interest of the Players.\n\n# Ten Example Secrets\nHere are ten example secrets for our \"Scourge of Volixus\" adventure:\n- The Hobgoblins are building a terrible city-destroying war machine in the western mountains.\n- The war machine was forged in the fires of the Nine Hells centuries ago, and was lost in a great battle.\n- The Hobgoblinshave Gnome tinkerers and alchemists working on the war machine, but it isn't clear whether those are prisoners or allies.\n- A Hobgoblin Half-Dragon veteran known as Volixus the Burning Rage leads the Hobgoblins.\n- In addition to his Goblin and Hobgoblin army, Volixus has hired a band of Igre mercenaries known as the Bonemashers.\n- The Hobgoblins have taken over a ruined mountain fortress known as Grayspire.\n- Centuries past, Grayspire served as the fortress headquarters of High Lord Grandel Whitesparrow, but it fell into ruin long ago.\n- A nearly limitless series of sewers and catacombs spreads out beneath Grayspire‚Äîincluding some caverns and ancient ruins said to predate the construction of the citadel.\n- Wraiths haunt the old Watchtower of Set, which sits above tunnels connecting it to the lower levels of Grayspire.\n- The library of Lord Whitesparrow might hold old maps or clues to navigating the sewers and tunnels beneath Grayspire.\nIt's easy to see how these sample secrets tie monsters, NPCs, and locationst ogether. Some of these secrets and clues stand alone, while others lead to deeper secrets and more complex clues. All of them descibe a single fact the Characters and Players can learn as they adventure.\n\n# Checklist for Defining Secrets and Clues\n- Write down ten secrets and clues that the Characters might discover in the next game session.\n- Secrets and clues are the connective tissue of a campaign. After the start of the adventure, they're the second most important thing to prepare.\n- Each secret or clue reveals a piece of the story or the history of the world and its inhabitants. \n- Keep secrets and clues abstract from how they might be revealed. Improvise the discovery of secrets during the game.\n- Throw away secrets that aren't revealed during a session. Write a fresh list each time.","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.463823275Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Return-of-the-Lazy-Dungeon-Master/Chapter-7-Develop-Fantastic-Locations":{"title":"Chapter 7 - Develop Fantastic Locations","content":"#lazydm\nThe way of the Lazy Dungeon Master helps us separate those things that are easily improvised from those things worth preparing. Building fantastic locations, for example, isn't easily done at the table. When we try to improvise locations, we're likely to fall back on stereotypical castles, familiar dungeons, and the samme old pair of huge statues with their hands out flanking the river. We need unique locations that inspire Characters to explore and that Players will remember. Thus, during our preparation, it's worth taking the time to develop a handful of fantastic locations that might come up during the game.\n\n# What is a Fantastic Location?\nA fantastic location can be anything. Some are as small as a single large room or chamber. Some are as large as an entire building. A city, a castle, or an entire dungeon is likely too large to be identified as a single location. It's better to split up the areas of such large sites into a series of fantastic locations.\n\nYou can think of a fantastic location as the set or backdrop for a single scene. As such, the size of the location should match the scope of the scene. In a scene focused on combat, the location might be just a room or chamber. In a larger exploration scene, it might be a series of interconnected rooms. When you're building a dungeon, each main room or area of related chambers can serve as a fantastic location.\n\n# Start with an Evocative Name\nFor each fantastic location, you need only two components: an evocative name and the location's aspects. The name of the location should fire up the imaginations of you and the Players alike. It should capture the attention of the Players when you describe it. You don't need to write paragraphs of descriptive text for a location, though. You just need enough of a reminder to help you describe it to the Players during the game.\n\nEvocative names cover locations like the following:\n\n- The Hill of the Great Skull\n- The Bridge of Teeth\n- The Path of Screams\n\nObviously, different people reading the names of those locations might have different images immediately pop into their heads. But you aren't writing down your fantastic locations for anyone else. Rather, the evocative name is meant to **bookmark the image you had in your head**, creating a note that will remind you of that location when you need it during the game.\n\n# Location Aspects\nWith an evocative name in place, it's time to add some useful details to your fantastic location. We'll call these *aspects*‚Äîa term borrowed from the *Fate Core* roleplaying game. These aspects act as short descriptive tags for your location.\n\nIn general, you'll want to have three aspects for a fantastic location, each of which describes an important, notable, or useful feature of the location. Aspects are features that the Characters can interact with, and that will mater to them. They also help you add detail to the location beyond the evocative name, by forcing you to build more of the location in your head while you prepare. With these aspects, a location becomes more than just an abstract vision.\n\nThe three locations above suggest any number of possible location aspects.\n\n- **The Hill of the Great Skull:** Huge sabertoothed bestial skull bursting out of the ground; sharp bone shards thrust up out of the earth; circle of glyphs on the skull's forehead\n- **The Bridge of Teeth:** Narrow bridge of bone spanning a gorge; bones tied together with cracked and splitting leather and sinew; howling wind sounds like moaning\n- **The Path of Screams:** Icy path winding around sheer mountainous drop; faces frozen screaming in the icy walls; continuous small avalanches\n\nSome of these aspects are descriptive. They'll remind you of what's going on at the location. All of them **offer something to the Players and Characters.** They're something to investigate, something to interact with. Some of those interactions might be really bad, like a sheer mountainous drop. Others might secrets or undsicovered power, like the glyphs on a huge skull's forehead. These aspects bring a tiny piece of each of these fantastic locations to life. They're often the things that make a location fantastic.\n\nYou might be tempted to write down more details than just the evocative name and aspects of a location‚Äîbut you're best off ignoring this temptation. If you put too much energy into a location, you'll want to use it, even if the path of the story steers away from it. As with secrets and clues, you could end up throwing away even the most fantastic location if it never comes into play. You should prep only enough to help you run a location at the table‚Äînot so much that you feel invested in it.\n\n# What Makes a Location Fantastic?\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Return-of-the-Lazy-Dungeon-Master/Chapter-8-Outline-Important-NPCs":{"title":"Chapter 8 - Outline Important NPCs","content":"#lazydm","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Return-of-the-Lazy-Dungeon-Master/Chapter-9-Choose-Relevant-Monsters":{"title":"Chapter 9 - Choose Relevant Monsters","content":"#lazydm","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Templates/Monster-Template":{"title":"Monster Template","content":"*Medium Creature, Unaligned*\n\n#monster\n\n**Challenge Rating:** 0\n**Knowledge DC:** 0\n\n**Armor Class:** 0\n**Hit Points:** 0\n**Speed:** 0\n\n---\nSTR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA\n:--:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:\n0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0 \n+0  | +0  | +0  | +0  | +0  | +0  \n\n---\n**Damage Vulnerabilities:**\n**Damage Resistances:**\n**Damage Immunities:**\n**Condition Immunities:**\n**Skills:** N/A\n**Senses:** N/A\n**Languages:** ‚Äî\n\n---\n### **Traits**\n\n---\n### **Actions**\n\n---\n### **Bonus Actions**\n\n---\n### **Reactions**","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Templates/Session-0-Template":{"title":"Session 0 Template","content":"- Organization\n\t- [ ] How will we schedule our campaign?\n\t- [ ] How long will our campaign be in sessions?\n\t- [ ] How long will each session be?\n\t- [ ] If someone can't come or is late, what do we do?\n- Overview\n\t- [ ] Potentially Sensitive Topics\n\t- [ ] Homebrew Rules and Mechanics\n\t\t- [ ] [[Knowledge Checks]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[Spell Scrolls]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[Conditions#Exhausted|Exhaustion]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[Lasting Injuries]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[Short Rests]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[Piety]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[Factions]]\n\t\t- [ ] [[1st Level Feat]]\n\t- [ ] Making Characters\n\t\t- [ ] What Ancestry\n\t\t- [ ] What Background\n\t\t- [ ] What Class\n\t\t- [ ] What [[1st Level Feat]]\n\t\t- [ ] Connections to other Player Characters\n\n| Player   | Character   | Class | Race | Background |\n| -------- | ----------- | ----- | ---- | ---------- |\n| Player 1 | Character 1 | Class | Race | Background |\n| Player 2 | Character 2 | Class | Race | Background |\n| Player 3 | Character 3 | Class | Race | Background |\n| Player 4 | Character 4 | Class | Race | Background |\n| Player 5 | Character 5 | Class | Race | Background |\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Templates/Session-Prep-List-Template":{"title":"Session Prep List Template","content":"Checklist\n- Session Preparation\n\t- [ ] Review Characters\n\t- [ ] Strong Start\n\t\t- [ ] What's happening?\n\t\t- [ ] What's the point?\n\t\t- [ ] Where's the action?\n\t- [ ] Outline potential scenes\n\t- [ ] Secrets and Clues\n\t- [ ] Fantastic Locations\n\t- [ ] Important NPCs\n\t- [ ] Relevant Monsters\n\t- [ ] Magic Item Rewards\n\n- Secondary List","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Templates/Single-Page-Lazy-DM-Prep-Template":{"title":"Single-Page Lazy DM Prep Template","content":"# Fifteen Minute Session Zero Checklist\n- [ ] Introduce the theme of the adventure.

Actual size doesn't matter, a district can be anything from a genuine district to the farms on the eastern side of hamlet of 100 people. There is no limit to the number of locations in a district, but a minimum of three is a good starting point.  You can add more locations as necessary if the Players wish to delve deeper into a specific district, but you usually don't need anymore than three to flesh out the character of a district enough to make it interesting and believable. Finally, districts focus on locations that you believe the Players might go to. There should be at least 3 districts, but no more than 12.\n\n## District 1 Name\nWhat makes this district unique?\n1.

Location of Interest\n\n# Wilderness Locales\nTowns do not exist in a vacuum, they will have wilderness locales surrounding them. These could be a deadly dungeon, a circle of standing stones, or the lair of a powerful monster. They do, however, have some things in common. They should have a simple description, usually a few sentences until the Players seem interested. Second, an explanation on why the locale hasn't already been explored, plundered, or claimed. Finally, the locale should have something about it that draws the attention of the Players. It could simply be a pile of gold, or as esoteric as the promise of a forgotten secret. There should also be at least 1 more Wilderness Locale than there are Districts as it keeps the focus on adventuring.\n\n## Location of Interest 1\n- What it is:\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable:\n- Why it's adventure worthy:\n\n## Location of Interest 2\n- What it is:\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable:\n- Why it's adventure worthy:\n\n## Location of Interest 3\n- What it is:\n- Why it's untamed/unclaimable:\n- Why it's adventure worthy:\n\n# Threats\nThreats are a quick tool to make your settlements feel active and responsive, while also allowing you to quickly come up with interesting events and quests. Threats operate off of a simplep rinciple, that having a centralized list of active issues in the town allows a DM to create a town that feels three dimensional while still being easy to run. There are two types of Threats, Internal Threats and External Threats. Secondly, Threats fall in one of four categories, being either Political, Social, Martial, or Economic. For example, a Red Dragon demanding more gold from the town would be an External Economic Threat. While this could edge into other categories, this is meant to be a shorthand, not nuanced. Next we ask how the threat is manifesting. The Red Dragon has been flying over the town once a week, and he sends Kobolds after each visit, who cause trouble and demand tribute. Next we ask the crucial question of how is this *actively* causing problems, and who, specifically, this is disrupting or harming. The Red Dragon has killed the leadership as an example in the past, but never the workers that provide the actual gold it wants. Finally, we ask more more important question, why hasn't this already been dealt with. If the town has the current ability to solve the issue, then it isn't a Threat. \n\nThe ratio of Internal to External Threats can say a lot about the nature of a settlement. A settlement with more Internal Threats could be choking under its own weight, the people within might be at each other's throats, or powerful individuals or groups could be cutting the town into pieces as they grasp for more power. A settlement with more External Threats could be barely keeping itself from being overrun by the oppressive wilderness, or could be beset upon all sides by schemers and political forces that take any number of hostile actions upon the town.\n\n## Internal Threats\nThere should always be at least 3 Internal Threats, and, with larger cities, a number equal to the number of districts minus two might be appropriate. Not all Internal Threats need to be massive, but they should at least be felt across an entire district. If they are not, they are a separate, smaller issue, and not an Internal Threat. Moreover, while this is not always the case, an Internal Threat is often an issue that arises from a specific district. Looking at each district and asking what could disrupt it is a good way to get inspiration for Internal Threats.\n\n### Internal Threat 1\n- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic\n- How is the Internal Threat manifesting\n- How is the Internal Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming\n- Why hasn't it been dealt it\n\n### Internal Threat 2\n- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic\n- How is the Internal Threat manifesting\n- How is the Internal Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming\n- Why hasn't it been dealt it\n\n### Internal Threat 3\n- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic\n- How is the Internal Threat manifesting\n- How is the Internal Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming\n- Why hasn't it been dealt it\n\n## External Threats\nExternal Threats can be anything outside the boundaries of the settlement, but a particular focus on issues arising from uncivilized or monstrous sources can reinforce the lawlessness of a setting, while a focus on other settlements can create more political tensions.\n\n### External Threat 1\n- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic\n- How is the External Threat manifesting\n- How is the External Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming\n- Why hasn't it been dealt it\n\n### External Threat 2\n- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic\n- How is the External Threat manifesting\n- How is the External Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming\n- Why hasn't it been dealt it\n\n### External Threat 3\n- Category of Threat: Political, Social, Martial, or Economic\n- How is the External Threat manifesting\n- How is the External Threat actively causing problems, and who is it disrupting/harming\n- Why hasn't it been dealt it\n\n# Relationships\nA Relationship should be active and juicy, and should have a good verb. \"They need Town X\" is a bad Relationship. \"They rely on Town X for protection, but are unthankful for it\" is better, but \"They need Town X's protection, but resent the superior, condescending attitude of Town X\" reveals even more. These should be a generalization, made from the POV of the average member of the settlement in question. Named NPCs have their own thoughts. Make one of these per important populated location that interacts with the town.\n\n## Nearby Populated Location Name\n- How does X Location feel about the Settlement\n- How does the Settlement feel about X Location\n\n*credit to u/Lazeerlow on reddit for the template*\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/The-World-of-Caino/DM-Tools/Terminology/Conditions":{"title":"Conditions","content":"#### Blinded\n- A Blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any Ability Check that requires sight\n- Attack Rolls against the creature have Advantage, and the creature's Attack Rolls have Disadvantage\n\n#### Charmed\n- A Charmed creature can't Attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects\n- The charmer has Advantage on any Ability Check to interact socially with the creature\n\n#### Deafened\n- A Deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing\n\n#### Exhausted\n- This Condition is cumulative.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-14T16:09:36.467823253Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so, otherwise the generated page will not have a title!\n\nYou can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`\n2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`.

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect!
